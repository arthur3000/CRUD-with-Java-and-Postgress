# CRUD-with-Java-and-Postgress
A simple CRUD app in java with PostgreSQL integration.

Console app that allows you to connect a Postgress DB to a Java App in order to do CRUD operations such as create a new entry from user input, show all available entries in the table, modify the information of a existing element and delete an entry.

Since this is just source code, you might need the following to run:<br/>
* Intellij IDEA Community Edition 2018.3.1
* JDK 11
* Postgresql 11.2
* PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.2.2

*Note: if you want to run the code as is, you will need edit the DB connection info on DbAdapter.java to match yours.*
